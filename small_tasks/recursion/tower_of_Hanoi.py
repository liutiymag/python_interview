"""
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical problem where we have three rods and n disks. The goal of this puzzle is to move all the disks to another rod, obeying the following rules:

Move only one disk at a time
You canâ€™t place a larger disk over a smaller disk
The disks are put in ascending order of their size at the start.
